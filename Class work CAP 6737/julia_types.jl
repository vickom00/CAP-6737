# Types in Julia

- Julia is both very expressive and runtime efficient
- This is made possible because of the underlying compiler technology
- The main strategy for user interaction with the compiler is by defining custom types and methods that operate on those types
- Types and multiple dispatch go hand in hand and are key to effective Julia

## What is a type?

- Each piece of data in a program resides in memory (RAM) on the host computer
- We often assign names to data, which we call variables (in `x = "hello"`, `x` is a variable)
- At its most basic level, a variable is composed of
  1. An arrangment of 0's and 1's called bits
  2. An address to where in memory the data is recorded
  3. A `Symbol` representing the name we gave the data
- A **type** in Julia represents what kind of object is represented at a certain memory address
- Julia uses this type information to enable syntax (e.g. the `$` in a string to interpolate or the `.` access for an objects fields) and ultimiately decide what behaviors are defined to operate on the data

## Organizing types

- In Julia types are organized into a hierarchy
- At the top of the hierarcy is `Any` -- all objects are instances of `Any`
- At the bottom of the hierarchy is `Union{}` -- no objects are instances of `Union{}`
- In between these endpoints we have a rich family of types
- Each type can have at most one parent type (if not specified, default parent is `Any`)
- Types can actually come in a few different flavors...
"""

md"""
## Types of Types

- Abstract Types: cannot be created directly, but serve as nodes in a type hierarchy. Help us organize types into families and provide shared behavior for all members of the family
- Primitive types: provided to us by Julia and represent a collection of bits (e.g. `Float64`, `Bool`, and `Int8`). We *could* create them, but we won't. We won't say anything else about them here
- Composite Types: types that contain additional data called fields. An instance can be treated as a single value. This is what we typically define and use

> NOTE: all objects in Julia are instances of either primitive or composite types, and can be related to one another by sharing common abstract type ancestors
"""

# ╔═╡ cf05c2e7-c1db-45e3-9705-7ab4fc4d5448
md"""
## Abstract Types

- Abstract types help organize composite types into families
- For example, the number system in Julia looks like this
```julia
abstract type Number end
abstract type Real     <: Number end
abstract type AbstractFloat <: Real end
abstract type Integer  <: Real end
abstract type Signed   <: Integer end
abstract type Unsigned <: Integer end
```
- Note:
  - `Number`'s parent type is `Any`
  - `Real` is a special kind of `Number` and can be broken into two subgroups: `AbstractFloat` and `Integer`
"""

md"""
## Why Abstract Types?

- We said before we can't create an instance of abstract types...
- So, why do we have them?
- The primary reason to have abstract types is to introduced shared functionality via methods defined on the abstract type
- Example: suppose you needed to define a function `isint` to determine if an object is an integer
  - Without abstract types, you could have a long sequence of checks for if a variable is any integer type:  
"""

function isint1(x)
	for T in [
		Int8, UInt8, Int16, UInt16, 
		Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64, 
		Int128, UInt128
	]
		if isa(x, T)
			return true
		end
	end
	return false
end


# ╔═╡ 2117eda0-e242-4b83-b353-acf7a2d0ee94
isint1(10), isint1(1.0), isint1(UInt128(234901324987213))

# ╔═╡ 2da92364-844b-4711-a306-14dd9e4b4ff4
md"""
- With abstract types we can define two methods:
"""

# ╔═╡ dc6d68ab-946e-4b81-9ba7-fe5cb9128be2
isint(x) = false

# ╔═╡ 0b3fa12e-2ef9-4e8f-a24f-67ef07287d12
isint(x::Integer) = true

# ╔═╡ c512e6e9-6583-4fe9-bdd0-ed2090025465
md"""
- This has many benefits
  - Much simpler to write/reason about
  - More "fool proof": what if we forgot one of the "UIntXX" types?
  - More "future proof": what if a new type of integer gets introduced (e.g. `UInt256` like is widely used in blockchain data!)
  - Pushes work into the compiler:

## Composite Types

- Abstract types are very useful when used in conjunction with multiple dispatch (defining multiple methods of function with same name, but varying code depending on argument types)
- However, most often we create types to hold collections of related data together
- We do this using composite types
- A composite type can be created as follows:
```julia
struct Name <: AbstractParentType
    field1::Field1Type
	# more fields
end
```
- Note that the `<: AbstractParentType` is optional, as are types on all fields

## Exercises

- Create an abstract type called `Person`
- Create two composite subtypes of `Person` called `Friend` and `Foe`
  - Each of these should have fields `name` and `height_inches`
  - For friend you should also have a field `favorite_color`
  - MAKE SURE TO ADD TYPES FOR ALL FIELDS
- Create a third composite subtype of `Person` called `Stranger`, but without any fields
- Suppose we are trying to decide who to invite to a dinner party. Our rule is that friends should get a definite yes. Enemies a definite no. Strangers a 50%/50% toss up. However, if our spouse says we should invite a person, the answer is always yes
  - Create a function `should_invite_to_party` that implements that logic
  - HINT: you will need 4 methods. 3 of these have only one argument, the 4th has two

- In the cell at the bottom we have written a test case. You will know you've done this correctly when all the tests pass
